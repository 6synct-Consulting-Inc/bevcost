class FleetCell():
    """
    Class used to represent a fleet of vehicles.
    
    This class is used to calculate the CAPEX and OPEX of a fleet of vehicles 
    in a mine.
    
    An instance of the class should represent a homogeneous subset of vehicles 
    in the overall mine fleet. If the overall fleet contains several different
    makes or models of vehicles, each group of vehicles should be described by 
    its own FleetCell object.

    A class used to represent a group of workers.
    
    This class is used to calculate the labour costs and other OPEX related
    to the workforce in a mine. Workers in each instance of the class must be 
    homogeneous, i.e. all have the same role.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    info : str
        Description of the object class.
    business_params : dict
        Dictionary containing the analysis input parameters relating to 
        running the business (financial, energy costs, subsidies, labour rates, 
        etc.).
    data : dict
        Dictionary containing data on the workers (roles, 
        departments, number of personnel required each year).
    labour_rates : dict
        Dictionary containing the annual employment costs for specific roles.
    role : str
        Role assigned to the workers in the class instanace.
    location : str
        Geographic location of the workers in the mine.
    workforce : pd.DataFrame
        Pandas DataFrame containing the number of peronnel required each year.
    labour : pd.DataFrame
        Pandas DataFrame containing the labour costs per year.
    variables : dict
        Dictionary containing the class instance's attributes.
    
    Methods
    -------
    add_variable(name, value)
        Adds objects to the variables dictionary.
    get_variable(name)
        Returns objects from the variables dictionary by name.
    opex_analysis
        Determines the OPEX (i.e. labour costs) for the workers.
    execute_analysis
        Executes the steps to analyse the workforce object's costs.
        
        
    Notes
    -----
    Keys in the input dictionary: **data**
    
    role : str
        The type of role/vocation of the group of workers represented by the 
        class instance, e.g. underground miner or electrician.
    location : str
        The location in the mine the group of workers are assigned.
    personnel : dict
        A dictionary with two items, the first is a "date" key with 
        corresponding list of years. The second is a "workforce size" key with 
        a list containing the number of workers for each year.
    
    Keys in the input dictionary: **data**
    
    labour rates : dict
        A dictionary with two items, the first key is a role string, with 
        the corresponding value as the labour rate for that role (a float). The
